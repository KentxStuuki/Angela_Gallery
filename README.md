## What is the Nature of the business:  
### Background story of the Angela’s Galley: 

- When she was planning her own business which is photography, she knew that holding a 
camera and taking shots on her phone was for her. So, when she started owning a digital 
camera at the age of 7 instead of playing with some of her toys, she takes pictures with 
her digital cameras. She discovered that there was more than holding and taking pictures 
for fun or rather a hobby to kill time, but it is something that she enjoys. She enjoys taking 
pictures to store some core memories, it has a sentimental value, a little storage to keep 
and hold. Since then, whenever she takes pictures of some people she put passion into it, 
the dedication, the love, and support she receive made her knew that she should take this 
path and to inspire people of her generation that pictures aren’t just a simple photo but a 
memory to keep in touch from the past.
